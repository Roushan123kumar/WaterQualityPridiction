# Water Quality Pridiction

This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques, specifically MultiOutputRegressor wrapped around a RandomForestRegressor. It was developed as part of a one-month AICTE Virtual Internship sponsored by Shell in June 2025.

# Overview

Access to clean water is a critical global concern. Accurate prediction of various water quality metrics can help in early detection of pollution and ensure timely intervention.

In this project, we:

   â€¢ Collected and preprocessed real-world water quality datasets  
   â€¢ Used supervised machine learning for multi-target regression  
   â€¢ Built a pipeline using MultiOutputRegressor with RandomForestRegressor  
   â€¢ Evaluated the model using appropriate regression metrics  

# Technology Used

  â€¢ Python 3.12  
  â€¢ Pandas, NumPy â€“ Data handling  
  â€¢ Scikit-learn â€“ Machine learning model and evaluation  
  â€¢ Matplotlib, Seaborn â€“ Data visualization  
  â€¢ Jupyter Notebook â€“ Interactive experimentation  

# Predicted Water Quality Parameters

The model predicts multiple water quality parameters such as:
   â€¢ NHâ‚„  
   â€¢ BODâ‚… (BSK5)  
   â€¢ Colloids  
   â€¢ Oâ‚‚ , NOâ‚ƒ , NOâ‚‚ , SOâ‚„ , POâ‚„  
   â€¢ Cl  

# Model Performance

The model was evaluated using:
   â€¢ RÂ² Score  
   â€¢ Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   
Performance was acceptable across all parameters
