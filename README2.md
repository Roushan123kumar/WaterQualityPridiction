# ðŸ’§ Water Pollutants Prediction Web App

This project is a **Machine Learning + Web App solution** that predicts the **concentration of six key water pollutants** (Oâ‚‚, NOâ‚ƒ, NOâ‚‚, SOâ‚„, POâ‚„, and CL) for river monitoring stations in **Ukraine** based on **historical water quality data (2000â€“2021)**. It uses **Random Forest Regression** for modeling and **Streamlit** for deployment as a user-friendly web interface.

## ðŸ“Œ Why I Chose This Project

I chose this project because **water quality** is a vital concern in environmental science, public health, and sustainable development. Understanding how pollution levels may change over time can help:
- Environmental agencies monitor water safety
- Predict future contamination risks
- Plan timely intervention at high-risk stations

Also, this project gave me the opportunity to explore **real-world environmental datasets**, apply **machine learning**, and **build a complete data science pipeline** from raw data to a deployed model.

## ðŸš€ What the Project Does

### ðŸ”¹ Inputs:
- **Year** (e.g., 2024)
- **Station ID** (e.g., 1â€“22)

### ðŸ”¹ Outputs:
- Predicted pollutant levels for that station and year:
  - Dissolved Oxygen (Oâ‚‚)
  - Nitrates (NOâ‚ƒ)
  - Nitrites (NOâ‚‚)
  - Sulphates (SOâ‚„)
  - Phosphates (POâ‚„)
  - Chlorides (CL)

### ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used:
- `pandas`, `numpy` for data handling
- `RandomForestRegressor` inside `MultiOutputRegressor` to predict multiple pollutants simultaneously
- `joblib` to save/load the model
- `Streamlit` for creating a user interface

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

âœ… Handling real-world data with missing values  
âœ… Encoding categorical features using OneHotEncoding  
âœ… Training and evaluating a **multi-output regression** model  
âœ… Understanding **correlation between pollutants** through heatmaps  
âœ… Saving and deploying models using `joblib`  
âœ… Building and deploying a machine learning app using **Streamlit**  
âœ… Making my machine learning project **interactive and user-friendly**
